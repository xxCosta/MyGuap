## PLAN FOR THIS APP

I plan on using this app to record my trading journey:

As of today, it will track my weekly trades inclduing a written summary in 
markdown with plans to automatically receive trade info from mt5 (or wherever I
place trades). 

08/21 TODO LIST:
    (These are inevitably subject to iteration in the future, with expanded explanations and fully fleshed-out concepts. 
    This is just an outline of an Idead thats currently in my brain)
    - [] create Bun application to serve markdown
    - [] create Vue application to show:
        - Stats
            - Section for weekly performance
            - Section for trends (ex: average R:R)
        - Calender
            - 1 month on 1 page
            - Every day will have a square that will take up the entire page
            - Every trading day will be clickable which will open an in depth
              look at the trade, including the long markdown summary.
            - Every clickable day will have a hover that will show the setup
            - Every trading day will have stats including (will look to expand
              this list eventually):
                - Win/Loss
                - % profit
                - $ profit
                - Setup type
                - R:R
